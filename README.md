#Nanomsg Tutorials

I'm just messing around with the nanomsg lib. Mostly a learning experiance.
feel free to check in once in a while.

##Usage

To build the bus tutorial:

```
make bus
```


To run the bus tutorial:

```
make run
````

To do both:

```
make
```

Yep, it's that easy. Unless you, haven't installed nanomsg, or a Compiler, or make, or Linux...
Yea nevermind.
